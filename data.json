The court cited a 1979 court decision in a case involving church groups. In the decision, the court said, \"Clearly, the Mahr Agreement in the case... is nothing more and nothing less than a simple contract between two consenting adults. It does not contravene any statute or interests of society.\"</p>\n\r<p>As The Institute of Social Policy and Understanding <a href=\"http://www.ispu.org/pdfs/Asma.religious.freedom.pdf\">explains in an August 2012 report</a>: \"When dealing with contracts written with Sharia principles in mind, civil courts have always only referred to Sharia as a tangential issue instead focusing on issues within their competence, such as the basic principles of contract law. When it comes to enforcing religious arbitration awards, civil courts do so only to the extent that these awards comport with American public policy. These practices apply to contracts and arbitration awards based on principles from any religion.\"</p>\n\r<p><a href=\"http://newsok.com/u.s.-judge-permanently-bans-oklahoma-islamic-law-vote/article/3872460\">On August 15, 2013, a federal judge struck down an Oklahoma state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited state courts from considering or using Islamic teachings</a>, also known as 'Sharia,' as this prohibition would have infringed upon American Muslims' constitutionally-protected religious freedoms. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/08/applying-gods-law-religious-courts-and-mediation-in-the-us/#islamhttp://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/08/applying-gods-law-religious-courts-and-mediation-in-the-us/\">According to a 2013 Pew Research Center study on religion and public life</a>, Islamic teachings concern many aspects of Muslim life, including \"crime and punishment; marriage, divorce and inheritance; banking and contractual relations; and diet and attire.\" Some Islamic teachings are directly based on the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (called the Hadith), while other teachings are based on scholarly interpretations of general Islamic principles.</p>\n\r<p><a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nj-superior-court/1141693.html\">Click here</a> to see Superior Court of New Jersey decision in the case of Odatalla v.

The first is the \"greater jihad\", or the inner struggle against one's own evil impulses, such as greed, anger and malice. \"Greater jihad\" includes doing good works and charity in accordance with the will of God. The second form of jihad is \"lesser jihad\", or physical struggle against injustice in the world. It is important to note that this is not just a scholarly definition: this is how the majority of more than a billion Muslims worldwide understand jihad. This description agrees with the findings of <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/7333/jihad-holy-war-internal-spiritual-struggle.aspx\">Gallup poll report</a> on what jihad means to everyday Muslims around the world.</p>\n\r<p><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/7333/jihad-holy-war-internal-spiritual-struggle.aspx\">Click here</a> to see Gallup poll report.</p>\n\r<p><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8000066-essential-islam\">Click here</a> to see link to book by Diane Morgan titled, \"Essential Islam: A comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice\".</p>\n\r",
